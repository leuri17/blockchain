1. Install docker desktop + docker-compose CLI
2. Run the following command inside this folder:

docker-compose up --no-recreate -d

This will create one container: a persistent volume for the database, install postgres image, and expose
the database.

BLOCKCHAIN'S DATABASE
    Name: db_blockchain
    Container name: db_blockchain
    Exposed port: 5433
    User: root_blockchain
    Password: root_blockchain

3. Connect to db_blockchain database using the previous credentials through your favorite SQL client.
4. Execute ./Scripts/DDL.sql script file to create the database and tables
5. Execute ./Scripts/mock_data.sql file to populate the tables with mock data.

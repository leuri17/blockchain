1. Install docker desktop + docker-compose CLI
2. Run the following command:

docker-compose up --no-recreate -d

This will create two containers: a persistent volume for each database service, install postgres image, and expose
the database services in different ports.

 FLIGHT SERVICE'S DATABASE
    Name: db_flight
    Container name: db_flight
    Exposed port: 5433
    API User: root_flight
    API Password: root_flight

METRICS SERVICE'S DATABASE
    Name: db_metrics
    Container name: db_metrics
    Exposed port: 5434
    API User: 
    API Password:

3. Connect to db_flight database using the previous credentials through your favorite SQL client.
4. Execute db_flight/DDL_flights.sql script file to create the database and tables
5. Execute db_flight/mock_data_flights.sql file to populate the tables with mock data.
6. Execute db_metrics/DDL_metrics.sql script file
7. Execute db_metrics/mock_data_metrics.sql
